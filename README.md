# Kitchen Sink Games
THIS IS INCOMPLETE. LIKE VERY INCOMPLETE

The following is a collection of games I'm making to practice on my new programming skills! I plan for this to be a gui collection of small minigames, like a surprise bag of sorts! It'll be my first attempt at working on a large-scale project!
This is developed and packaged on first and foremost linux, but I will give mind to other operating systems! 

Feel free to make an issue on any bugs or criticisms!
